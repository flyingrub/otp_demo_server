    <h1>OTP Demo</h1>
    <p>
      This demo is constructed from a simple web service and its android application counterpart. This makes use of
      the secure nature of OwnPush to send fast, safe, and secure passwords to an Android device. After the apk is
      installed & registered on the the android device the user is shown a short, unique device ID that they can enter
      on a simple web form. On submission of this form the OTP is randomly generated and send to the device securely.
